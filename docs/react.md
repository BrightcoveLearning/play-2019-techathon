# React

[React][react] is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We will be using React for this project as an example of how to integrate with the Brightcove Player and Brightcove APIs in a modern framework.

You can brush up on React using the [official docs][react] or try out [ReactArmory][course] to get up to speed on the main concepts.

## Project

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started). It is kept as simple as possible but assumes you have following:

- [git][git]
- [node.js][node]
- [npm][npm]
